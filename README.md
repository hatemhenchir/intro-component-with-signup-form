# Intro Component with Signup Form

This is a solution to the Intro Component with Signup Form challenge from Frontend Mentor, built using ReactJS and the `useForm` hook from the `react-hook-form` library.

## Overview

The Intro Component with Signup Form challenge requires building a responsive sign-up form that includes validation and error messages. The form should have four input fields: the user's first and last name, email, and password. The validation requirements are as follows:

- Email should be a valid email address
- Password should be at least 8 characters

The form is built using the `useForm` hook from the `react-hook-form` library. This allows for easy form management, validation, and error handling.

If any of the validation requirements are not met, the form should display an error message.
